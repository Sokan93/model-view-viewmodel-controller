# Hierarchical model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel

The Hierarchical model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel software architectural pattern attempts to refine the [model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) architecture pattern for systems that use [JIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) dependency injection.

# Overview

The Hierarchical model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel solves the problem *[how to work with modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)?*

This document will describe how to:

- Pass information from modules to their submodules
- Pass information from submodule to their parent modules
- Communication between modules

# Structure

The Hierarchical model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel uses a the [model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) architecture while borrowing the and [Hierarchical model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller) software architectural pattern's "widgetization" contect structure.

# Lifecycle

## Creation

1. The controller is instantiated
1. models are injected into the controller
1. viewmodels are instantiated
    1. models are injected into the viewmodel
    1. viewmodels are instantiated
        1. repeat üîÅ
    1. viewmodels are bound to their views
1. viewmodels are bound to their views

## Distruction

1. viewmodel is destoryed
    1. collect child viewmodels
    1. destory viewmodels
        1. repeat üîÅ

# Communication

Local controllers can directly communication with other controllers or external controllers. Only parent controllers are allowed to communication with it their viewmodels.
